# JS-API-Weather-App

This application provides a simple weather forecast based on user queries in one of two formats.

In the leftmost form, users can enter a US city/state, neighborhood/city, or city/country combination. The rightmost form takes in a US zip code.

Data is retrieved from two 3rd party APIs upon clicking "Get Weather": OpenWeatherMap API provides current forecast, and Bing Maps API provides an aerial satellite image of the area.


This incorporates basic PHP to allow Heroku to adapt its available build packs toward deploying this application.
